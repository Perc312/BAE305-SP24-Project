# BAE305-SP24-Project


ClawMachine1 code runs the line sensor and X and Y axis motors (gantry). (code currently in progress)

ClawMachine2 code runs the Z axis motor and the servo motor for operating the claw. (code currently in progress)


Testing:
 - Use motorspeeds code to check the motors
 - Use servomotortest code to check the servo
 - Use linesensortest code to check the sensor
 - Use DataToAppTest to check communication between the app and arduino
